## Description

The Global Vegetation and Climate Insights Portal is an advanced web application developed using Google Earth Engine (GEE). This tool facilitates dynamic visualization and analysis of global vegetation and climate indicators such as Evapotranspiration, Leaf Area Index, and NDVI. It allows users to explore environmental conditions across the globe through an interactive map interface.

### Key Functionalities Include:
1. **Interactive Mapping:** View and analyze global environmental data layers dynamically.
2. **Data Layer Selection:** Users can select from a variety of data layers including NDVI, Evapotranspiration, and Land Surface Temperature.
3. **Time-Range Filtering:** Adjust the time range to visualize data from specific periods.
4. **Automated Scaling:** Data values are scaled appropriately for effective visualization.
5. **Region-Specific Analysis:** Focus on a specific geographic area for detailed environmental insights.
6. **Legend and Visualization:** A dynamic legend updates based on the selected data layer to represent value ranges with corresponding colors.

This portal leverages the comprehensive satellite data archives available within Google Earth Engine, providing researchers, educators, and policy makers with crucial information for environmental monitoring, agricultural planning, and climate research.
